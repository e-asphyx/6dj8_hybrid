# DC coupled hybrid headphone amplifier
The input stage was inspired by Cavalli’s SOHA-II, but I have choose different output design. I use source follower loaded to Norton level shifter fed by op amp DC servo (inspired by TI’s LME49600 reference design) via current mirror to drive simple MOSFET source follower with SSC.
